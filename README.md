INI2XML
=======

Simple conversion utility to convert a .ini file into xml.

Really old utility I wrote (in VS2003, I think), to convert a .ini file into an XML DOM and save it with as input_filename.xml.

It was pretty much just a proof-of-concept I used to introduce my new development team to .Net and C# back in 2004.

I only keep it for sentimental reasons XD
